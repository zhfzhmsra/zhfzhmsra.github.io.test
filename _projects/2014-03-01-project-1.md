excerpt: 'Friendships are dynamic. In this project, we uncover the dynamics of tie strength and online social interactions in terms of various aspects, such as reciprocity, temporality, and contextually. Based upon these dynamics, we build a learning to rank framework to predict social interactions in online social networks.'
