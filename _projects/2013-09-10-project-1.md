## Sensing the Pulse of Urban Refueling Behavior

Urban transportation is increasingly studied due to its complexity and economic importance. It is also a major component of urban energy use and pollution. The importance of
this topic will only increase as urbanization continues
around the world. A less researched aspect of transportation
is the refueling behavior of drivers. In this paper, we propose
a step toward real-time sensing of refueling behavior and citywide petrol consumption. We use reported trajectories
from a fleet of GPS-equipped taxicabs to detect gas station visits, measure the time spent, and estimate overall demand. For times and stations with sparse data, we use collaborative filtering to estimate conditions. Our system provides real-time estimates of gas stations' waiting times, from which recommendations could be made, an indicator of overall gas usage, from which macro-scale economic decisions could be made, and a geographic view of the efficiency of gas station placement.
